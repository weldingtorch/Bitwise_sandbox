# Bitwise_sandbox
A sandbox for studying bitwise operations and logic gates

This application was designed to be a lab where you can build logic circuits and experiment with some basic concepts.
In Bitwise sandbox you can create and destroy logic gates, and using wires you can connect them to each other.
Every logic gate and wire has its own very intuitive indication of states(on/off/undefined), so it is easy to track the whole circuit state.
